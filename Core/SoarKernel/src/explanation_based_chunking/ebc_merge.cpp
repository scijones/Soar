/* -- Variablization_Manager::merge_conditions
 *
 *    Requires: Variablized condition list that does not have any conjunctive
 *              tests containing multiple equality tests
 *    Modifies: m_lhs list (may delete entries and move non-equality tests
 *              to other conditions)
 *    Effects:  This function merges redundant conditions in a condition list
 *              by combining constraints of conditions that share identical
 *              equality tests for all three elements of the condition.  At this
 *              point the conditions are variablized, so it is merging based
 *              on the unified variables, not the wmes matched.
